      <h2>Genius is evenly distributed. Opportunity is not.</h2>
      <p>Millions of brilliant young minds across Africa remain undiscovered, not due to a lack of talent, but a lack of discovery mechanisms. They are invisible to the global systems of education and investment. This isn't a talent gap; it's a <strong>systemic failure of detection</strong>.</p>
